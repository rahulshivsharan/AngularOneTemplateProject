                                    <span>TRACK20 TOOL: CONVERT SERVICE STATISTICS DATA TO "EMU (Estimated Method Use)" FOR FPET</span>
                                </div>
                                <h5 class="version">Version 3 : January 2017</h5>
                                <p class="info">Track20 has developed this tool to assist countries in reviewing their service statistics data and converting it into estimates of modern method use (EMU is a proxy for mCPR), that can be used as input in the Family Planning Estimate Tool(FPET). Inclusion of recent service statistics in FPET allows for more accurate estimates of contraceptive prevalence in years beyond the last national population-based survey. For more information on FPET, and instructions of how to use FPET, visit Track20 website <a href="www.track20.org">www.track20.org</a></p>

                                <p class="nextParagraph">This tool will produce the estimates of modern method use (EMU) from routine data that can be used as input data in FPET. These estimates, while meant to approximate modern contraceptive prevalence, should not be used as mCPR estimates anywhere in FPET. Read on to find out if your service statistics data are suitable for use in FPET.</p>

                                <div class="infocontainer">
                                    <h4><b>ARE YOUR SERVICE STATISTICS DATA SUITABLE FOR INCLUSION OF FPET ?</b></h4>
                                    <p>Not all the service statistics data are suitable for use in FPET. The annual estimates need to be comparable to each other. So, while it may be acceptable for the service statistics to be biased or have data quality issues, these baises/issues must be consistent accross the years for which your are producing these estimates. <b>These ensures that the trend between these data points, which will affect the project FPET results curve, is accurate and reflects the actual trend in the family planning use in out country.</b></p>
                                    <p>That the data present an accurate, consistent trend is of utmost importance, because FPET will use the trend/change between these estimates, and not the actual magnitude/value of each point estimate, to inform the FPET results. In fact, the final EMU that results from your service statistics data may be very different in value from your country's actual mCPR. For the purposes of including Service Statistics in FPET, the value of the EMU does not hold much meaning, it's the change in this value over time that we wish to capture through use of this routine data.</p>
